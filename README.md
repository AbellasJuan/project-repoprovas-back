  ## How to run

1. Clone this repository

2. Create a Database using the ``dump.sql`` file inside the ``dump`` folder by following these steps:
    - 2.1 Open your terminal. **Important: the terminal must be opened in the same path as the ``dump.sql`` file is located.**
    - 2.2 Access PostgreSQL using the command ``sudo su postgres`` and enter your password when prompted.
    - 2.3 Next, type ``psql postgres`` and hit enter.
    - 2.4 Create a database by typing ``CREATE DATABASE repoprovas;`` and hitting enter.
    - 2.5 Type ``\q`` and hit enter.
    - 2.6 Finally, type ```psql repoprovas < dump.sql``` and hit enter. Your database should be ready after this step.
2. Set the environment variables by following these steps:
    - 3.1 Create a ``.env`` file in the folder root
    - 3.2 Copy the content of the ``.env.example`` into it
    - 3.3 Set the ``DATABASE_URL`` in this format: "postgres://user:password@host:port/repoprovas"
    - 3.4 Set the ``PORT`` for 4000
3. In your terminal, go back to the root folder and install the dependencies
```bash
npm i
```
5. Also in the root folder, run the back-end with
```bash
npm start
```
6. Your server should be running now.
7. After that, you can optionally test the project following these steps:
    - 7.1 Open your terminal.
    - 7.2 Access PostgreSQL using the command ``sudo su postgres`` and enter your password when prompted.
    - 7.3 Next, type ``psql postgres`` and hit enter.
    - 7.4 Create a test database by typing ``CREATE DATABASE repoprovas_test TEMPLATE repoprovas;`` and hitting enter. Your database test should be ready after this step.
    - 7.5 Set the enviroment variable following the step 5 again, with the following changes:
      - 7.5.1 The file must be called ``.env.test``
      - 7.5.2 The ``DATABASE_URL`` must be in this format: "postgres://user:password@host:port/repoprovas_test"
    - <b>Important</b>: the tests assume that some tables are pre-populated. Therefore, it is important to use the dump provided to create the test database.

8. In your terminal, go to the root folder and run the tests with:
```bash
npm run test
```
